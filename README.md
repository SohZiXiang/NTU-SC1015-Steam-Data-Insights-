- Tan Kia Chun - Developed the Positive Negative Review Prediction model using decision tree classifiers, and managed data preprocessing and feature selection.

## Problem Definition
Our project aims to analyze sentiments in user-generated Steam reviews, offering valuable insights for gamers and developers alike

## Conclusion
In the end, focusing on what players really care about—like making controls easier, improving graphics, and creating fun gameplay—can lead to better reviews for developers. By making games more accessible, listening to players, testing games well, and building strong communities, developers can make sure players love their games and give them great reviews

The pivotal role that nuanced features like 'Game Age' and 'Achievements' play in predicting game reviews, with the models achieving up to 76% accuracy. The insights gained underscore the potential of machine learning to guide game development and marketing strategies.
